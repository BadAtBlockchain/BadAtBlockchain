- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BadAtBlockchain
- Documenting my #100daysofcode, with a specific focus on Solidity (with some web3/js thrown in)
- I will be creating all my smart contracts and projects targetting the Harmony protocol
- I plan to document my work on Twitter and Github, with both code and write ups of my progress

Like my content? Is it helping you? Support me and the Harmony protocol with $ONE, $LOOT or $MOONI!
